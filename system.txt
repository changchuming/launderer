Inspired by the brilliance of my friend Jonathan Ten, I am proposing a system to centralize the usage info of our laundry machines which enable easy checks and reminders. I want to run this idea through the computing & engineering students in this college, especially Adrian Chan & Ethan Chou, as well as as everyone else if you have any feedback.

The basic idea is to have a push button and an LED to indicate whether the machines are in use. These states are pushed onto a server, so you can check the current status on a website. There will also be an NFC reader so optionally, you can tap your matric card when you press the button to have notifications sent to you when the timer is up. For the floors with coin machines, an additional button and LED will be present.

Email notification is the easiest because we have all the information you need with your matriculation number. Sms notifications will be more difficult because each user will need to do a one time setup to pair their matriculation number with their phone numbers. (Amazon SNS service; Costs?) (Other types of notification?)

A mock up of the website is available here. Anyone good with UI (no matter whether you program or not) and want to help please let me know. A diagram and state changes describing the system is below. Everything will be open-sourced so anyone can contribute.

1. State: LED off; User presses button - timer starts
2. State: LED on;  Timer times out - LED turns off, user receives notification
3. State: LED on;  User presses button - timer resets; any pending notifications cancelled

An additional benefit is that we will have usage info so we can let you see the heat graphs so you know when the peak periods are and you can avoid them. Is it feasible? Will you use it? Do we need to worry about jokers just pressing these buttons for fun? Let me know what you think.
